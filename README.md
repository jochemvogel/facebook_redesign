# Facebook Clone

With help of some tutorials I would've created a Facebook clone with Laravel & Vue based on the redesign Facebook revealed in 2019. I had no experience with Laravel, so I thought I would be a nice challenge. But I found out that I don't like working with Laravel (nothing bad about Laravel, but at the end of the day I'm still a front-end developer), so I choose to implement the redesign in Tailwind (& Vue) instead of creating a whole working application in Laravel. Had a little experience in Tailwind, so it was a nice project to improve my knowledge.

I'll be working on this project for a while, because I can implement stuff that I've learned and will learn in the future (for the most part Vue). Maybe someday I'll go further with a working application in Laravel, but for now I'll stick with front-end.
